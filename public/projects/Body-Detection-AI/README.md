# AI-Powered Clothing Fit Finder for Shopify

This project helps users find well-fitting clothes on Shopify using artificial intelligence. With just a single front-facing photo, the system extracts precise body measurements and suggests clothes that match the user's real body size. The application uses computer vision to analyze a user's body shape and provide personalized clothing recommendations. It seamlessly integrates with Shopify to enhance the online shopping experience.
